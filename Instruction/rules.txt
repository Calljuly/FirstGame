Use your keyboard arrows to guide the snake: up, left, right and down.
If you are on a tablet or smartphone, swipe the direction you want the snake to go.
We recommend landscape mode if you're on a smartphone (this means you should flip your phone:)

The "space" key will pause the game, press "space" again to resume.

Eat the treats to gain points.

As you gain points the graphics of the game will gradually evolve.

If you advance long enough in the game, not only will it look great, but you will also get the chance to eat "p-treats". 
These ones hold a surprise... But you must be quick! They dissapear after 10 sec.

Can the snake "walk through" the walls? Oh it would be to easy if we just told you! Give it a go. 
Worst thing that can happen is... you die... fortune favors the brave!

If you score high enough, you just might make it to the top ten highscore list.

Good luck and have fun!
